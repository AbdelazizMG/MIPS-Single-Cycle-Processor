# MIPS-Single-Cycle-Processor


The simulation was performed on Modelsim using the following three programs written in machine code following MIPS ISA:
- Program 1: GCD of 120 and 180.
- Program 2: Factorial Number of 7.
- Program 3: The Fibonacci series numbers.

The synthesis was done on Intel® Quartus Prime and implemented on Cyclone® IV FPGA.
